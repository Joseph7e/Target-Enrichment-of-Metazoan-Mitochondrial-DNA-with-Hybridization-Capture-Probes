### Figure 1: Count the number of mitochondrial genomes available on NCBI

### Coverage per million reads (CPM) from BED

Coverage data was then normalized based on the starting read counts to produce coverage per million reads (CPM) using an in-house python script. 

### Annotation correction


### Coverage data and CIRCOS

Circular figures depicting mitochondrial genome annotations and coverage were constructed using custom scripts in Python v3.6.1 and the Circos software package (Kryzywinski et al. 2009). Creation of boxplots, and scatter plots were completed in R Studio v 3.5.1 using ggplot2 (Wickham 2016).
